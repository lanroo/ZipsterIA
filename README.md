# **ZipsterIA**

**ZipsterIA** is a modern and powerful library developed in **TypeScript** for automating and integrating with WhatsApp Web. Inspired by best practices, it enables you to create intelligent bots and interact programmatically with WhatsApp.

With ZipsterIA, you can send messages, manage groups, send media, and customize automatic responses, all with security and flexibility.

---

## **About**

ZipsterIA works by connecting to WhatsApp Web using **Puppeteer**, a browser automation tool for Chrome-like browsers. It simulates a browser interacting with WhatsApp Web, enabling near-total automation.

The use of **TypeScript** in ZipsterIA ensures safer and more efficient development with native support for autocompletion, type checking, and best practices.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** While this library minimizes risks, WhatsApp does not officially support bots or unofficial clients. There are no guarantees that your account will not be blocked while using this method.

    console.log('QR Code generated. Scan it with WhatsApp!');
});

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log('WhatsApp connected!');
});

client.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Message received: ${message.body}`);
    if (message.body === '!ping') {
        message.reply('pong');
    }
});

// Initialize the client
(async () => {
    await client.connect();
})();
```

## **Advanced Features**

1. **Persistent Authentication**:
   Save your session to avoid scanning the QR Code every time you restart the bot.
   ```typescript
   client.on('authenticated', (session) => {
       console.log('Session authenticated:', session);
       // Save the session in a file or database
   });
   ```

2. **Send Media**:
   ```typescript
   client.sendMessage('552199999999@c.us', {
       content: 'Hello, this is a message with media!',
       media: './path/to/image.jpg',
   });
   ```

3. **Group Management**:
   Add or remove participants:
   ```typescript
   await client.addParticipant('group-id@c.us', 'participant-id@c.us');
   await client.removeParticipant('group-id@c.us', 'participant-id@c.us');
   ```
